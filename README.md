# Project Title

Vaccine effectiveness of 3rd generation Orthopoxvirus vaccines against mpox infection and disease severity: A systematic review and meta-analysis.

## Description

Here we wish to estimate the vaccine effeciveness (VE) of vaccines with efficacy against mpox. Here we provide the code to estimate for VE of 3rd generation vaccines and subseuqent quality assessment. Inforamtion for first generation vaccines has also been extrated but code has been "#" out so the code does not run.

* MVA_BN.csv is used for paper summary info
* MVA_BN_long.csv is used for individual VE information
* Case_Cont_NOS.csv, Cohort_NOS.csv, Cross_sect_NOS.csv provide Newcastle Ottawa quality assessments and are provided for reference but not used in the code.
